//! Implement an asteroid struct that is drawn as a spinning hexagon with constant velocity
//! random position constructor!
//! - figure out where vertexes are relative to the origin
//! - rotate those vertexes according to the rotation matrix
//! - add those rotated vertexes to the position of the hexagon
//! - draw a line between each vertex
